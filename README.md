## Executive Summary
Share music between friends to avoid boring music playlist in trips or parties.

###The problem
Some times you travel with friends in some of their personal cars and everybody want to listen their favorite music in the car speakers, but along all the travel the car owner just play his favorite music and the passengers get bored and the trip is not funny enough for all.

###Goal for the prototype
Build an Android application that allows to create a local network with 2 android devices and play music in one specific device(the Media Player/Speaker) from the two devices in the local network.
